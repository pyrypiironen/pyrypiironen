# Hello world, Iâ€™m Pyry! ðŸ‘‹ 

âœ¨ Iâ€™m a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), a [42 coding school](https://42.fr/en/homepage/), and soon to be a software developer.

âœ¨ I'm currently looking for my first internship.

## Some of my recent projects

[Corewar](https://github.com/pyrypiironen/Corewar)

The implementation of a 1984-created programming game Core war.

[Lem_in](https://github.com/pyrypiironen/Lem_in)

In this project, we will be given a graph, including the locations of the nodes and the connections between them.
Our task was to find the most efficient combinations of paths through the graph from the starting node to the ending node. 
During the Lem-in, I learned about graph theory, algorithm design, and implementing efficient solutions in code.

[Push_swap](https://github.com/pyrypiironen/Push_swap)

This project made me sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
Push_swap taught me how to manipulate various types of algorithms and create the most appropriate solution for optimized data sorting.

[Delivery fee calculator](https://github.com/pyrypiironen/Delivery_fee_calculator)

A smaller weekend project made me use Python, JSON, and HTTP API first time. Based on Wolt Summer 2023 Engineering Internship preliminary assignment for backend position. 

## Hive Helsinki

Hive Helsinki is a new kind of coding school that is based on peer-to-peer learning. We have no teachers, classes, or workbooks but instead of that
we seek and share knowledge through teamwork while solving real-world problems. The curriculum is organized around projects that provide a practical
way to introduce new topics. It is based on the pioneering program and content of Ecole 42. With great results in 42 Paris and Silicon Valley, this
program is now used in over 40 campuses around the world. 

Projects are afterward validated via a series of evaluations by our peers based on grading scales defined by the pedagogical staff. At Hive it is
not enough to get your programs work, the standard is higher (no memory leaks, code must be clean, etc). 

The programming language at the school is C, which teaches us the fundamentals of coding in the best possible way. After learning the ins and outs
of C, we will understand what lies beneath any coding concept and how they really work. That gives us good skills to learn other programming languages
in the future.
